## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Through this challeng, i learn more on howw to get usefull with my skills and able to build something real.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<main>Some HTML code I'm proud of</main>
<section>Some HTML code I'm proud of</section>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: hsl();
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I will want to continue focusing on JS, React.js, Node.js, Python, MySQL, Git, cloud and Database in future projects. These are concepts i'm still not completely comfortable with or techniques i found useful that i want to refine and perfect.
